# Contributing to SpocWiki

Thank you for your interest in contributing! 

SpocWiki is a community effort to build a structured, interoperable knowledge-web. 
Because this data is intended to be mirrored across many personal vaults, we maintain high standards for structure and licensing.

## 📋 Before You Start
1.  **Read the Standards:** All contributions must adhere to the rules defined in [SpocWiki/_Standards](https://github.com/SpocWiki/_Standards).
2.  **Check the License:** Ensure any data you add is compatible with our [License](https://github.com/SpocWiki/_Standards/blob/main/License.md).
3.  **Search First:** Check existing Issues and Pull Requests to see if someone is already working on the same data set.

## 🛠️ Data Standards
* **Format:** Use Markdown for text and YAML for frontmatter.
* **Naming:** Follow the "No Spaces" rule. Use `Kebab-Case`, `Snake_Case`, or `Tilde~Specialization` for disambiguation.
* **Hierarchy:** Place files in the correct geographic or thematic folder. If a repository is getting too large, suggest a new sub-repository in an Issue.
* **Multimedia:** Large files (high-res `.png`, `.svg`) should be proposed for the `xLarge` repository rather than the primary data repos.

## 🚀 How to Contribute
1.  **Fork** the relevant repository.
2.  **Create a Branch** for your changes (e.g., `fix/germany-population-2026`).
3.  **Commit** your changes with clear, concise messages.
4.  **Open a Pull Request** against the `main` branch. 

*Note: Substantial structural changes require a discussion in an Issue before a PR will be accepted.*
