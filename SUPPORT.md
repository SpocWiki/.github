# Support for SpocWiki

Need help integrating SpocWiki into your personal vault or have questions about our data standards? 
Here is how to get support:

## 🔍 Search the Documentation
Before reaching out, please check the [SpocWiki/\_Standards](https://github.com/SpocWiki/_Standards) repository. 
Most questions regarding file naming, YAML attributes, and repository structure are answered there.

## 💬 Community & Questions
* **GitHub Discussions:** For general questions, "how-to" advice, and sharing how you use SpocWiki in Obsidian, visit our [Discussions tab](https://github.com/orgs/SpocWiki/discussions).
* **Issue Trackers:** If you find a specific error in a dataset, open an issue in the **corresponding repository** (e.g., `Europe-Germany`).

## 🛠️ Obsidian Support
While we love Obsidian, we cannot provide technical support for the Obsidian application itself. Please visit the [Obsidian Forum](https://forum.obsidian.md/) for software-specific troubleshooting.
