# Security & Data Integrity Policy

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability in our repository structure or automation scripts, 
please **do not open a public issue.** 

Instead, please send a report to [the administrator](mailto:10584012+SpocWeb@users.noreply.github.com).

## Data Integrity & Vandalism

As SpocWiki hosts public data, the integrity of our information is paramount. 
* **Reporting Misinformation:** If you find factual errors or "data vandalism," 
  please open an **Issue** in the specific repository and label it as `data-integrity`.
* **Verification:** We may request sources (e.g., Wikidata IDs or official government links) to verify changes to sensitive datasets.

## Supported Versions

We only support the `main` branch of our repositories. P
lease ensure your local mirrors are synchronized with `main` to receive the latest updates.
